	<h1>How Slimsonic Works</h1>
</div>
<div class="group clear">
  <div class="left_col">
		<p>Evita Slimsonic system uses advanced ultrasound waves to safely and painlessly shrink a specific type of adipose fat cell. These ultrasound waves work on a frequency of 800Khz. The Slimsonic has two power levels (high and low) and depending upon the power level reaches a depth of approximately 3 - 5 centimetres beneath the skin surface. It targets and stimulates fat cells into releasing water, free fatty acids, and glycerol (Triglycerides). This causes fat cells to shrink significantly, resulting in noticable inch loss for patients.</p>

    <h2>Scientific Research</h2>
		<p>Evita Slimsonic has accumulated years of scientific research and rigorous tests for safety and effectiveness. Evita Slimsonic advanced ultrasound and microcurrent therapy, speeds up the fat melting process. Slimaction slimming gel special formula penetrates deep into the fat layer of the skin to make it possible for the ultrasound waves interact with the fatty cells to start the body's natural fat burning process. The body breaks fatty tissues down into glycerol and free fatty acids, which are then used as building blocks or energy processed by the liver. This process reduces the amount of fats in the body, resulting in inch loss and a firm and toned appearance.</p>

		<p><strong>Cellulite reduction therapy</strong><br/>
Cellulite is caused by badly laid down fat cells which accumulate in problem areas such as the tummy, hips, thighs, arms and legs. The combination of technologys behind the Evita Slimsonic destroy stubborn membranes of fat cells beneath the skin. The broken down fat is then dissipated by the body's natural mechanism of clearing out waste and damaged tissues. This process prevents and reduces cellulite. </p>

    <p><strong>Slimming and Weight loss therapy:</strong><br/>
Evita Slimsonic safely breaks down body fats which makes you lose inches around your waist, legs, or arms. This combination aggressively targets fatty areas in the:</p>
		<p><li>Lower abdomen</li><p>

		<p><li>Thighs</li><p>
		<p><li>Arms</li><p>
		<p><li>Legs</li><p>

 

    <p><strong>Prevent and reduce stretch marks:</strong>
Collagen fibers help rebuild tissues create a healthy firmness in the skin. Ultrasonic waves emitted from the Evita Slimsonic into the skin create a vibration which stimulates collagen and heat production within the tissues. (The heat is unlikely to be felt by the user.) Heat in tissue increases the flexibility in the skin structure, this flexibility prevents and reduces the appearance of stretch marks.</p>

    <p><strong>Healing and pain-relief therapy:</strong><br/>

Massaging frequently with Evita Slimsonic and Essential gels for just 10 minutes daily, activates the cells and stimulates tissue fibers. The effect is obvious for relieving pain and accelerating recovery. Ultrasonic massage excites the cells and strengthens tissue fibers, effectively helping to inhibit the aging process.</p>

		<p>The ultrasound function of Evita Slimsonic stimulates deep body tissue, and eases physical discomforts and supports muscle relaxation and rehabilitation. Natural heating of body tissue, stimulated by the ultrasonic waves and the EMS technology of Evita, increases the flexibility of ligaments, tendons, scar tissue and fibrous joints, to loosen stiff bodies and soothe aches and pains.</p>
