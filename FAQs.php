    <h2>How does Evita Slimsonic achieve inch loss / spot fat reduction?</h2>
    <p>Evita Slimsonic is the only proven personal spot fat reduction system that uses ultrasound technology to cause lipolysis of fat cells, thus reducing the amount of fats in the body to achieve inch loss and a slimmer body. This precise technology targets only fat cells, meaning only fat is broken down.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="2"></div>
    <h2>What happens to the broken down fat?</h2>
    <p>Broken down fat is processed by the body's natural mechanism and expelled from the body.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="3"></div>
    <h2>What areas of the body can be treated with Evita Slimsonic?</h2>
    <p>Abdomen, flanks ("love handles"), inner and outer thighs ("saddle bags"), and arm dewlaps are common treatment areas. Clinical studies have also proven Evita Slimsonic to be safe and effective on these common problem areas. Please avoid using Evita Slimsonic over bony areas.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="4"></div>
    <h2>Is Evita Slimsonic safe?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Evita Slimsonic is non-invasive and uses the safest technology, regulated by the FDA and used in hospitals and clinics worldwide. It is also CE-certified. There is no pain, no discomfort and no recovery time involved with use of Evita Slimsonic.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="5"></div>
    <h2>How long is each treatment?</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over when and where you enjoy Evita Slimsonic. You determine the amount of time to spend on each treatment. The minimum treatment time recommended is 10-20 minutes. For best results, it is recommended to repeat the treatment on desired area two to three times a week.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="6"></div>
    <h2>What should I do before treatment?</h2>
    <p>Ultrasound waves require a conductive gel to allow it to penetrate deep into the fat layer of the skin. For maximum benefits, apply a generous amount of Slimaction Gel to treatment area before using Evita Slimsonic.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="7"></div>
    <h2>What should I do after treatment?</h2>
    <p>There is no downtime associated with use of Evita Slimsonic. You may resume normal activities as soon as the treatment is over. To maintain steady results, limit alcohol intake and drink two liters of water a day, both to stay hydrated and to assist in flushing toxins and tissue waste out of your body.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="8"></div>
    <h2>What results can I expect?</h2>
    <p>Massaging frequently with Evita Slimsonic and Slimaction Gel for 10-20 minutes a day breaks down fat cells, increases resting metabolic rate, as well as restoring vitality in tissue fibers, including stimulation of collagen and elastin synthesis.
Results are: Visible, long-lasting body slimming, reduction in appearance of stretch marks and cellulite.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="9"></div>
    <h2>How does it prevent and reduce cellulite and stretch marks?</h2>
    <p>Cellulite is lumpy deposits of fats. Evita Slimsonic and Slimaction Gel break down these fatty deposits, which are expelled from the body, thus diminishing the presence of cellulite.<br/>
Stretch marks are caused by loss of collagen and elastin fibers. Evita Slimsonic passes ultrasonic waves into the skin, stimulating production of collagen fibers and elastin synthesis responsible for skin elasticity, which prevents occurrence of stretch marks.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="10"></div>
    <h2>What is Slimaction Gel?</h2>
    <p>Slimaction Gel is a specially formulated gel made from natural herbal extracts that stimulates the fat burning process. It is highly recommended for use with Evita Slimsonic, both as a conductor for ultrasound waves to penetrate deep into the fat layer of the body and lubricant for the ultrasound probe to glide more easily over the skin.</p><br/><br/>

    <div id="11"></div>
    <h2>Why is Slimaction Gel recommended for use with Evita Slimsonic?</h2>
    <p>Slimaction Gel stimulates collagen and elastin synthesis to reverse the signs of stretch marks and cellulite. In addition, Slimaction Gel is highly recommended for use with Evita Slimsonic to help you attain maximum benefits:</p>
    <p><li>Conductor gel for ultrasound waves - air is a poor conductor of ultrasound, hence a conductive gel is necessary to effectively transfer ultrasound waves into the body. Ultrasound without gel is ineffective.</li></p>
    <p><li>Lubricant to enable ultrasound probe to glide more easily over the skin.</li></p>
    <p><li>Protect ultrasound probe, lack of gel can cause damage to the machine.</li></p><br/><br/>

    <div id="12"></div>
    <h2>When will I begin seeing results?</h2>
    <p>Evita Slimsonic breaks down fats in the body. The contents of broken down fat cells are naturally cleared by the body over a 2 to 4 week period. Circumference and fat thickness reduction is usually seen within the first 14 - 28 days. Maximum results are seen after 28 days of consistent treatment.</p><br/><br/>
