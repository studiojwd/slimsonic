		<p>"I'm a convert. Once a skeptic about slimming gels and treatments, Prodacta Essentials has proven me wrong! My husb bought the Slimaction Gel to â€˜fix' the cellulite problem I have been whining about and while I was all ready to write a negative review about it, I now have to write this testimonial to say Man! This Thing Really Works. Just ordered myself and my sister a set of Evita Slimsonic and more gels!"<br/>
